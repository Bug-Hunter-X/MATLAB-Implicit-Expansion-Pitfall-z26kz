This repository demonstrates a common error in MATLAB programming related to implicit expansion.  Implicit expansion is a convenient feature, but it can lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully considered. The `bug.m` file shows an example where the addition of a column vector and a row vector might produce unexpected results.  The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version using explicit array manipulation to ensure the correct element-wise addition.
